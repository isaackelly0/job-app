# My Own Personal Website

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

I built this site as a guide to project repos on my github that I'm particularly fond of, done in a more casual-friendly way than browsing through a catalog of projects.

It's built with React's router so you can browse through each focused language in the header, and the sidebar on each page allows quick scrolling to each project in particular. 

Each project preview comes with a summary and links to the hosted pages and the github repos, so feel free to have a look!
